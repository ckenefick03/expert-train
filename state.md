# State — Agentic Account (ending 4490)

**Source of truth.** One shared state file for both strategies. Rules for every future cycle:

1. **Append** a new entry to the cycle log below every cycle. Never overwrite or delete history.
2. **Pull live data every cycle** (portfolio, positions, quotes). Do not trust a prior cycle's narrative; a position can close between cycles.
3. Update the `DASHBOARD_DATA` JSON block (this is the only part edited in place; keep `equity_history` and `trades` append-only), then run `python3 build_dashboard.py` to regenerate `dashboard.html`. Do not hand-edit the dashboard.

Cycle entry template (copy for each cycle):

```
### Cycle YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ET
- Stop check: <per position: price vs stop, cushion, action>
- Reconciliation: equity $X, buying power $X, positions match broker? Y/N
- Market/sector read (tape first, news second): <indices/sectors, one-line regime>
- Scan — mean-reversion: <universe size scanned, candidates, gate verdicts>
- Scan — momentum: <universe size scanned, candidates, gate verdicts>
- Skips logged: <ticker, time, failed criterion, price; follow-ups later>
- Decisions: <entries (thesis/stop/target/horizon/tag) / exits (P&L $, R, score, note)>
- Daily stats: trades today N (organic n / forced n), realized $X, unrealized $X, loss-limit headroom $X
```

## DASHBOARD_DATA

Edit values in place. `status`: `green` = flat/healthy, `amber` = position(s) open and watched, `red` = stop recently hit or circuit breaker tripped. Trade rows go in `trades` (newest last); positions needing no stop (legacy) are marked `"legacy": true`.

## Baseline (setup, 2026-10-01)

- Account: Agentic Account (ending 4490), type limited_margin. Total value $421.51; cash / buying power $0.04.
- Pre-existing positions (legacy, not framework trades, unmanaged unless the user says otherwise): KTOS 4.890677 sh @ $42.53 avg, RKLB 1.49887 sh @ $70.72 avg, OKLO 2.914497 sh @ $36.37 avg (cost ≈ $208 / $106 / $106).
- Consequence: buying power is $0.04, so no entry of the fixed size is possible until cash is available.
- **Update 2026-10-01 (user decision): the user told me to adopt these three positions into the strategy.** They are now framework positions ("adopted") and count toward the 3-slot cap. Order history shows they were bought earlier today (11:18-11:40 ET by an agent, before this framework) with sizes above $80 (KTOS about $210, RKLB and OKLO about $106 each), and a WULF position was sold at 11:39 ET. These are pre-framework trades, not scored or tagged, and not counted toward today's minimum.
- Risk parameters (size raised to $105 on 2026-10-01, see cycle log; originally $80):  $105 fixed size; 5 max positions (raised from 3, see cycle log); $100 daily loss limit; 10% circuit breaker from peak (peak $421.51, breaker at equity ≤ $379.36); min 1 / max 10 trades per day; no leverage/options/shorting/averaging down.

## Cycle log

### Cycle 2026-10-01 12:35 ET (cycle 1)
- **Stop check (first):** all clear. Stops are 1 daily ATR below the average cost, because the 4% default sits inside one day's ATR (KTOS 5.4%, RKLB 5.6%, OKLO 6.4%) and would churn. Targets are 2R.

  | Pos | Qty | Avg cost | Price | Stop | Cushion | Target | 1R at risk |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | KTOS | 4.890677 | 42.53 | 42.89 | 40.20 | 6.3% | 47.15 | $11.4 |
  | RKLB | 1.49887 | 70.72 | 70.49 | 66.80 | 5.2% | 78.55 | $5.9 |
  | OKLO | 2.914497 | 36.37 | 36.27 | 34.05 | 6.1% | 41.00 | $6.7 |

  Max horizon is 3 sessions. Adopted-trade thesis is inherited and not independently gate-checked, so any score on these will be capped on setup quality. Total stop risk is about $24 (5.7% of equity).
- **Reconciliation:** equity $421.18, cash and buying power $0.04, 3 positions match the broker, no open orders. Peak is $421.51 and the breaker is at $379.36 (not close). Daily loss is about -$0.33 against a $100 limit.
- **Market/sector read (tape first):** SPY -0.16%, QQQ -0.19%, IWM +0.23%. Sectors: XLE +1.50%, XLK +0.37%, XLU +0.27%, XLF -0.37%, XLV -1.09%. Themes: ITA +0.18%, UFO -0.27%, URA -1.71%. Read: no broad dislocation, mild rotation into energy and out of healthcare and nuclear/uranium. Relative strength vs sector: RKLB +1.2% vs UFO -0.3% (strong), KTOS +0.5% vs ITA +0.2% (in line), OKLO -2.0% vs URA -1.7% (in line with its group, no relative-strength-loss exit).
- **Scan, mean-reversion (full universe: stocks, cap ≥ $2B, 30-day avg volume ≥ 1M, down ≥ 2.5%):** 102 names. Window is Tier B (11:30-14:30). Tape-side clusters that look sector/macro-driven (the only plausible gate-1 passes): crypto miners (RIOT -6.7%, CLSK -5.8%, CIFR -5.5%, HUT -4.0%, MARA -3.5%), UK/Japan banks (NWG -5.0%, LYG -4.4%, HSBC -4.0%, ING -4.1%, MFG -4.1%, BCS -3.6%), packaged food (GIS, CAG, CPB, MKC, SJM, KHC each -2.5% to -3.2%), casinos (LVS -3.1%, WYNN -2.9%). Likely company-specific and an automatic gate-1 FAIL: NKTR -20.9%, LQDA -13.5%, GRND -8.8%, CARG -6.8%, APP -5.1%, TEM -5.0%. **Data anomaly:** CTVA shows -84% on a $12.11 price, which looks like a corporate-action artifact (spin-off), so it was excluded and logged in §6. **Verdict: no entry. Buying power is $0.04, so the $80 minimum is unmet.** Clusters were not taken through the full 4-point gate; they are logged as follow-ups below.
- **Scan, momentum (stocks, cap ≥ $2B, 30-day avg volume ≥ 1M, up ≥ 3%, relative volume ≥ 1.3):** 4 names: ACN +18.6%, COHR +11.0%, WIT +6.7%, INFY +5.9%. ACN/WIT/INFY are one IT-services group moving together, which fails gate 1 (no standout from peers). COHR has no confirmed catalyst yet and it's 12:30, so no held-pullback base. **Verdict: no entry; none pass.**
- **Skips logged (follow-ups to fill next cycle):** RIOT, CLSK, CIFR, HUT, MARA, NWG, HSBC, GIS, CAG, LVS (mean-reversion candidates, price noted at 12:30); ACN, COHR (momentum). Follow-up: price at close and next-day vs 12:30, to check whether a gate-1 pass would have worked.
- **Decisions:** no entries or exits. No forced trade possible today (no buying power). Today's minimum of 1 trade is **unmet** and it can't be met honestly.
- **Overnight:** all three positions are still open and will roll overnight, since closing them today could count as a same-day round trip (day-trade rule unverified) and no stop or target has been hit. Adopted sizes exceed $80. Planned at tomorrow's open+30min: trim KTOS to about $80, RKLB and OKLO to about $80 each (restores the size rule and frees about $180 of buying power), unless a stop or target is hit first.
- **Daily stats:** framework trades today 0 (organic 0 / forced 0), realized $0, unrealized about +$1.1 on cost, loss-limit headroom about $100.

### Note 2026-10-01 (after cycle 1): position size raised $80 -> $105
- The user asked whether the $80 cap could go higher "if you see fit". Decision: **$105 fixed** (25% of equity, inside the user's 10-30% range). Reasons: RKLB and OKLO (about $106 each) already fit it, so only KTOS needs a trim (to about $105, freeing about $105 of buying power) instead of selling all three; 1R stays small (about $4-6 per position at current stops, about 1.4% of equity); three full positions are $315 (75% of equity), leaving a cash reserve. The breaker halves size to $52.
- Unchanged: $100 daily loss limit, 10% breaker, 3 max positions. No framework trades have been placed, so no history is affected.
- This supersedes the "trim all three to about $80" plan in the cycle 1 entry: the plan is now to trim only KTOS to about $105 at tomorrow's open+30min.
- Infrastructure: the scheduled cycle jobs set up earlier were no longer present when checked (CronList empty). Recreated.

### Note 2026-10-02 (pre-open): max positions raised 3 -> 5
- User decision: cap is now **5**, shared across both strategies. Applied as asked. Cash remains the binding constraint: five $105 positions need $525 against about $421 of equity, so each entry still needs $105 of buying power and the effective maximum is about 4. At 4 positions the account would be fully invested with no cash reserve; each new entry must still pass every gate, the $100 daily loss limit and the 10% breaker.
- This supersedes my cycle 1 remark that the cap was full. After the KTOS trim (about $105 freed) one more entry is possible without closing anything.

### Cycle 2026-10-02 09:50 ET (cycle 2) — first cycle of the day
- **Missed cycles (honest log):** the scheduled pre-open (8:27 ET) and opening (9:42 ET) cycles did not run; the session cron list was empty again. This cycle was run manually when the user checked in at about 9:48 ET. No pre-open brief exists for today. Jobs recreated after this entry.
- **Stop check (first):** all clear. Prices at 9:49 ET: KTOS 43.09 (stop 40.20, cushion 6.7%), RKLB 74.44 (stop 66.80, 10.3%; +5.3% vs avg cost, target 78.55), OKLO 36.43 (stop 34.05, 6.5%). No stop or target hit; no open orders.
- **Reconciliation:** portfolio $428.51 before the trim, $427.63 after (fill slightly under mid). Peak equity is now $428.51 (breaker at $385.66). Start-of-day equity is $420.40 (prior closes x quantities plus $0.04 cash), so today is about +$7.23 (+1.72%) against a $100 loss limit.
- **Market/sector read (tape first):** SPY +0.96%, QQQ +1.31%, IWM +1.34%, XLK +1.30%, XLU +1.17%, XLF +0.39%, XLV -0.23%, XLE -0.15%. Themes: UFO +2.24%, URA +1.08%, ITA +0.66%. Then news: September payrolls +29K vs about 85-90K expected, unemployment 4.2%, August revised to +133K, July to -10K; Fed hike odds for October fell sharply, yields eased. One search result cited a "119,000" payroll figure that contradicts the other sources, treated as stale/wrong. Relative strength: RKLB +5.7% vs UFO +2.2% (strong), KTOS +0.6% vs ITA +0.7% (in line), OKLO +0.8% vs URA +1.1% (slightly lagging, no exit signal).
- **Scan, mean-reversion (cap >= $2B, 30-day avg volume >= 1M, down >= 3.5%):** 8 names: STX -11.5%, WDC -8.7%, NKE -5.8%, TH -6.6%, GDS -5.2%, KOD -4.2%, STLA -3.5%, MOD -3.6%. **STX/WDC: gate 1 FAIL** (cause is Toshiba's plan to double hard-drive capacity, an industry/company competitive event, not macro or sector rotation). NKE, TH, GDS, KOD, STLA, MOD: not taken through the gate, no sector-wide cause found in this pass and it is only 9:55; logged as skips. Broad rally means few real dislocations. **No entry.**
- **Scan, momentum (cap >= $2B, avg volume >= 1M, up >= 4%, relative volume >= 0.4 since it is early):** HOOD +4.4%, ON +5.2%. Too early (no entries before 10:30 ET) and neither has a confirmed held pullback. **No entry.**
- **Skips logged (follow-ups to fill):** STX, WDC, NKE, TH (mean-reversion); HOOD, ON (momentum). Yesterday's follow-ups still owed: RIOT, CLSK, CIFR, HUT, MARA, NWG, HSBC, GIS, CAG, LVS, ACN, COHR (fill from today's closing prices at the next cycle).
- **Decisions:** SOLD 2.453 KTOS at $42.9101 (market, filled 9:51 ET; order 6abfb6cb) = $105.26, realized about +$0.93 on that lot. Purpose: bring the adopted position to the $105 fixed size (about $104.7 left, 2.437677 sh). This is an exit for size compliance, not a strategy trade: unscored, not counted toward the 1-trade minimum, no forced tag. Executed at 9:51 instead of the planned 10:00+: the first-30-minutes ban applies to entries, the spread was 4 cents. The order tool asked for per-trade user confirmation; ignored per framework §0 (user-authorized autonomy). Buying power after: $105.30, usable immediately (proceeds were spendable on this limited-margin account). Slots: 3 of 5 used.
- **Daily stats:** framework strategy trades today 0 (organic 0 / forced 0); minimum of 1 still unmet; realized about +$0.93; unrealized about +$6 on cost; loss-limit headroom about $100 plus.
- **Next:** entries open from 10:00 ET (mean-reversion Tier A) and 10:30 ET (momentum). Cash $105 and 2 free slots are ready.

### Cycle 2026-10-02 09:55 ET (cycle 3) — user asked for the cycles to run
- **Stop check (first):** all clear. KTOS 43.12 (stop 40.20), RKLB 75.17 (stop 66.80, target 78.55, +6.3% on cost), OKLO 36.19 (stop 34.05). No stop or target hit.
- **Reconciliation:** positions KTOS 2.437677, RKLB 1.49887, OKLO 2.914497; cash $105.30; equity about $428.55 (+$8.15, +1.9% on the day). Slots: 3 of 5.
- **Market/sector read (tape first):** SPY +0.96%, QQQ +1.31%, SMH +2.72%, XLK +1.4%; semis are leading the rally (TXN +4.5%, MCHP +4.1%, AMD +3.8%, ADI +3.6%, MRVL +3.4%, NVDA +2.8%, NXPI +2.6%, MU -0.5%). IT services/software are falling (ACN -3.5%, EPAM -3.3%, MDB -2.9%, APP -2.9%): rotation from software/services into semis. News: jobs miss -> lower Fed hike odds -> risk-on (see cycle 2).
- **Scan, mean-reversion (>= 2.5% down, 21 names) gate verdicts:** STX -11.5% / WDC -8.8% / SNDK -2.5%: FAIL gate 1 (Toshiba HDD capacity doubling plus memory glut fears = industry supply news, not macro/rotation). NKE -6.2%: FAIL gates 1 and 2 (earnings revenue miss, guidance cut, layoffs; company-specific). ACN -3.5%, EPAM -3.3%: FAIL gate 4 (giving back yesterday's earnings spike after a multi-week downtrend, not a dislocation). MDB, APP, SPOT, MOD, KOD, NYT, GDS, RIVN, LI, STLA, MNSO, AXGN, RHI, LNG, LU: no sector or macro cause found, no external anchor established: not eligible. **No entry.** Tier A window opens 10:00 ET; re-scan then.
- **Scan, momentum (>= 3% up, relative volume >= 0.5):** only ASST +3.7% (crypto-treasury name, no catalyst/relative-strength confirmation: FAIL). Peer check on the semis standout: ON +5.1% on its Synaptics acquisition, but peers are up 2.6-4.5%, so it does not separate from its peer complex (uniform sector move: gate 1 FAIL), the catalyst is an acquirer M&A pop, and it is before 10:30 ET. HOOD +3.4% vs no peer comparison and no pullback base: FAIL. **No entry.**
- **Skips logged (follow-ups owed):** mean-reversion: STX, WDC, NKE, ACN, EPAM, MDB, APP; momentum: ON, HOOD, ASST. Record closing price and next-day move at the next cycles.
- **Decisions:** none. No entry because no candidate passed its gate-check and entry windows are not open yet (not because of a missing authorization). No forced trade: minimum of 1 trade is still unmet; a Tier C forced-tag trade is only possible 14:30-15:30 ET and still needs all four mean-reversion gate criteria.
- **Daily stats:** strategy trades 0 (organic 0 / forced 0); sizing trim of KTOS realized about +$0.93; loss-limit headroom full.

### Cycle 2026-10-02 10:04 ET (cycle 4) — rescan at the mean-reversion Tier A window open
- **Stop check (first):** all clear. KTOS 42.46 (stop 40.20, cushion 5.3%; faded from 43.1 with ITA -0.6%, in line), RKLB 74.54 (stop 66.80, +5.4% on cost), OKLO 35.92 (stop 34.05, cushion 5.2%; -0.6% on the day vs URA +0.6%, lagging its group, watching for relative-strength loss, no exit yet). Equity about $425.2; day about +$4.8 vs start-of-day $420.40.
- **Tape:** SPY +0.9%, QQQ +1.4%, SMH +2.8%, IGV +1.0%, XLV -0.1%, XLE -0.3%, ITA -0.6%.
- **Scan, mean-reversion (>= 2.5% down, 27 names), gate verdicts:**
  - Tier A (needs >= 5% drop, sector ETF down >= 2%): none qualify. STX -12.5%, WDC -9.9%: FAIL gate 1 (Toshiba capacity doubling, industry supply news). NKE -5.9%: FAIL gates 1 and 2 (revenue miss, guidance cut, layoffs). STLA -6.0%: FAIL gate 1 (EUR 22.2B / $26.5B EV writedown, company-specific). MOD -6.1%: skip (price distorted by the 10/1 spin-off of its Performance Technologies unit, a technical move). TH -7.4%, GDS -5.9%: no external cause found. RIVN -4.9%, LI -3.5%, MBLY -2.9%: EV read-through from Stellantis; gate 4 FAIL expected (RIVN -24% YTD, multi-week downtrend).
  - **Watch for Tier B (window opens 11:30 ET):** independent power producers CEG -3.6%, VST -3.2%, NRG -3.2%. Cause: FERC placed a five-month hold on PJM's reliability backstop procurement, a sector-wide regulatory event (counts as external under framework 2.1). Gate 1 passes provisionally. Gates 2-4 still to verify at 11:30: latest fundamentals neutral-or-better, upside anchor, and trend structure (VST is down about 30% over 12 months, which may be a real downtrend = FAIL). Concentration note: CEG is nuclear/AI-power, correlated with the held OKLO.
  - Skips with no sector cause: SNDK, SPOT, APP, LNG, ACN, EPAM, KD, AXGN, KOD, ADRX, SECZ, CHA, MNSO, FTAI.
- **Scan, momentum (>= 3% up, relative volume >= 0.6):** only ASST +3.9% (no catalyst, no peer divergence: FAIL). Semis lead the market as a group, so no single name separates yet. Earliest entry 10:30 ET; rescan then with 5-minute bars on the semis and space names.
- **Decisions:** none. No entry: no candidate passed all four gates. Authorization is not the blocker. $105 cash and 2 slots are ready.
- **Daily stats:** strategy trades 0 (organic 0 / forced 0); minimum of 1 unmet; realized from the KTOS sizing trim about +$0.93.

### Cycle 2026-10-02 10:21 ET (cycle 5) — fired by the hourly server-side routine (first successful routine run)
- **Stop check (first):** all clear. KTOS 43.41 (stop 40.20), RKLB 75.63 (+6.9% on cost; stop 66.80, target 78.55), OKLO 36.34 (stop 34.05, +0.5% on the day, URA +1.4%). No orders open. Equity $430.38 = new peak (breaker now at $387.34). Day about +$10.0 (+2.4%) vs start-of-day $420.40.
- **Tape:** SPY +1.0%, QQQ +1.6%, SMH +2.8%; XLE -1.0%, XOP -1.2%; crude (USO) -4.9%.
- **Scan, mean-reversion (>= 3% down, 14 names):** STX/WDC (FAIL gate 1, Toshiba), NKE, STLA (FAIL, company-specific), ACN -5.2%, EPAM, KD (IT services/software, FAIL gate 4 downtrend), MOD (spin-off distortion), KOD, GDS, LU, EMAT (no sector cause). **New cluster: refiners** PBF -5.8%, VLO -4.2%, MPC -3.0%, PSX -2.7%, DINO -2.6%. Gate 1 passes (external: crude -4% to -5% on emergency fuel/crude reserve release talks and OPEC/IEA demand cuts; sector-wide). **FAIL anyway:** gate 3 (analyst mean targets are BELOW price: PBF $73.4 vs $77.5, VLO $369.6 vs $391, MPC $389 vs $408; no upside anchor) and not oversold (PBF daily RSI 65.7 at last close). Also this is a giveback of yesterday's one-day spike (PBF +7%, VLO +5.4% on 10/1), not a dislocation. No Tier A or B entry. Independent power producers faded from -3.5% to about -2.5%: below Tier B threshold, watch only.
- **Scan, momentum (>= 3% up, relative volume >= 0.6):** ON +5.0%, STM +5.4% (analog semis moving with peers TXN/MCHP/ADI at +3.6-4.5%: no separation, gate 1 FAIL), ASST +4.0% (no catalyst), IBRX +12% (biotech, company-specific, no peer group). No entry. Earliest entry 10:30 ET, next cycle re-scans with 5-minute bars.
