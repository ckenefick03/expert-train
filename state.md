# State — Agentic Account (ending 4490)

**Source of truth.** One shared state file for both strategies. Rules for every future cycle:

1. **Append** a new entry to the cycle log below every cycle. Never overwrite or delete history.
2. **Pull live data every cycle** (portfolio, positions, quotes). Do not trust a prior cycle's narrative; a position can close between cycles.
3. Update the `DASHBOARD_DATA` JSON block (this is the only part edited in place; keep `equity_history` and `trades` append-only), then run `python3 build_dashboard.py` to regenerate `dashboard.html`. Do not hand-edit the dashboard.

Cycle entry template (copy for each cycle):

```
### Cycle YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ET
- Stop check: <per position: price vs stop, cushion, action>
- Reconciliation: equity $X, buying power $X, positions match broker? Y/N
- Market/sector read (tape first, news second): <indices/sectors, one-line regime>
- Scan — mean-reversion: <universe size scanned, candidates, gate verdicts>
- Scan — momentum: <universe size scanned, candidates, gate verdicts>
- Skips logged: <ticker, time, failed criterion, price; follow-ups later>
- Decisions: <entries (thesis/stop/target/horizon/tag) / exits (P&L $, R, score, note)>
- Daily stats: trades today N (organic n / forced n), realized $X, unrealized $X, loss-limit headroom $X
```

## DASHBOARD_DATA

Edit values in place. `status`: `green` = flat/healthy, `amber` = position(s) open and watched, `red` = stop recently hit or circuit breaker tripped. Trade rows go in `trades` (newest last); positions needing no stop (legacy) are marked `"legacy": true`.

## Baseline (setup, 2026-10-01)

- Account: Agentic Account (ending 4490), type limited_margin. Total value $421.51; cash / buying power $0.04.
- Pre-existing positions (legacy, not framework trades, unmanaged unless the user says otherwise): KTOS 4.890677 sh @ $42.53 avg, RKLB 1.49887 sh @ $70.72 avg, OKLO 2.914497 sh @ $36.37 avg (cost ≈ $208 / $106 / $106).
- Consequence: buying power is $0.04, so no entry of the fixed size is possible until cash is available.
- **Update 2026-10-01 (user decision): the user told me to adopt these three positions into the strategy.** They are now framework positions ("adopted") and count toward the 3-slot cap. Order history shows they were bought earlier today (11:18-11:40 ET by an agent, before this framework) with sizes above $80 (KTOS about $210, RKLB and OKLO about $106 each), and a WULF position was sold at 11:39 ET. These are pre-framework trades, not scored or tagged, and not counted toward today's minimum.
- Risk parameters (size raised to $105 on 2026-10-01, see cycle log; originally $80):  $105 fixed size; 5 max positions (raised from 3, see cycle log); $100 daily loss limit; 10% circuit breaker from peak (peak $421.51, breaker at equity ≤ $379.36); min 1 / max 10 trades per day; no leverage/options/shorting/averaging down.

## Cycle log

### Cycle 2026-10-01 12:35 ET (cycle 1)
- **Stop check (first):** all clear. Stops are 1 daily ATR below the average cost, because the 4% default sits inside one day's ATR (KTOS 5.4%, RKLB 5.6%, OKLO 6.4%) and would churn. Targets are 2R.

  | Pos | Qty | Avg cost | Price | Stop | Cushion | Target | 1R at risk |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | KTOS | 4.890677 | 42.53 | 42.89 | 40.20 | 6.3% | 47.15 | $11.4 |
  | RKLB | 1.49887 | 70.72 | 70.49 | 66.80 | 5.2% | 78.55 | $5.9 |
  | OKLO | 2.914497 | 36.37 | 36.27 | 34.05 | 6.1% | 41.00 | $6.7 |

  Max horizon is 3 sessions. Adopted-trade thesis is inherited and not independently gate-checked, so any score on these will be capped on setup quality. Total stop risk is about $24 (5.7% of equity).
- **Reconciliation:** equity $421.18, cash and buying power $0.04, 3 positions match the broker, no open orders. Peak is $421.51 and the breaker is at $379.36 (not close). Daily loss is about -$0.33 against a $100 limit.
- **Market/sector read (tape first):** SPY -0.16%, QQQ -0.19%, IWM +0.23%. Sectors: XLE +1.50%, XLK +0.37%, XLU +0.27%, XLF -0.37%, XLV -1.09%. Themes: ITA +0.18%, UFO -0.27%, URA -1.71%. Read: no broad dislocation, mild rotation into energy and out of healthcare and nuclear/uranium. Relative strength vs sector: RKLB +1.2% vs UFO -0.3% (strong), KTOS +0.5% vs ITA +0.2% (in line), OKLO -2.0% vs URA -1.7% (in line with its group, no relative-strength-loss exit).
- **Scan, mean-reversion (full universe: stocks, cap ≥ $2B, 30-day avg volume ≥ 1M, down ≥ 2.5%):** 102 names. Window is Tier B (11:30-14:30). Tape-side clusters that look sector/macro-driven (the only plausible gate-1 passes): crypto miners (RIOT -6.7%, CLSK -5.8%, CIFR -5.5%, HUT -4.0%, MARA -3.5%), UK/Japan banks (NWG -5.0%, LYG -4.4%, HSBC -4.0%, ING -4.1%, MFG -4.1%, BCS -3.6%), packaged food (GIS, CAG, CPB, MKC, SJM, KHC each -2.5% to -3.2%), casinos (LVS -3.1%, WYNN -2.9%). Likely company-specific and an automatic gate-1 FAIL: NKTR -20.9%, LQDA -13.5%, GRND -8.8%, CARG -6.8%, APP -5.1%, TEM -5.0%. **Data anomaly:** CTVA shows -84% on a $12.11 price, which looks like a corporate-action artifact (spin-off), so it was excluded and logged in §6. **Verdict: no entry. Buying power is $0.04, so the $80 minimum is unmet.** Clusters were not taken through the full 4-point gate; they are logged as follow-ups below.
- **Scan, momentum (stocks, cap ≥ $2B, 30-day avg volume ≥ 1M, up ≥ 3%, relative volume ≥ 1.3):** 4 names: ACN +18.6%, COHR +11.0%, WIT +6.7%, INFY +5.9%. ACN/WIT/INFY are one IT-services group moving together, which fails gate 1 (no standout from peers). COHR has no confirmed catalyst yet and it's 12:30, so no held-pullback base. **Verdict: no entry; none pass.**
- **Skips logged (follow-ups to fill next cycle):** RIOT, CLSK, CIFR, HUT, MARA, NWG, HSBC, GIS, CAG, LVS (mean-reversion candidates, price noted at 12:30); ACN, COHR (momentum). Follow-up: price at close and next-day vs 12:30, to check whether a gate-1 pass would have worked.
- **Decisions:** no entries or exits. No forced trade possible today (no buying power). Today's minimum of 1 trade is **unmet** and it can't be met honestly.
- **Overnight:** all three positions are still open and will roll overnight, since closing them today could count as a same-day round trip (day-trade rule unverified) and no stop or target has been hit. Adopted sizes exceed $80. Planned at tomorrow's open+30min: trim KTOS to about $80, RKLB and OKLO to about $80 each (restores the size rule and frees about $180 of buying power), unless a stop or target is hit first.
- **Daily stats:** framework trades today 0 (organic 0 / forced 0), realized $0, unrealized about +$1.1 on cost, loss-limit headroom about $100.

### Note 2026-10-01 (after cycle 1): position size raised $80 -> $105
- The user asked whether the $80 cap could go higher "if you see fit". Decision: **$105 fixed** (25% of equity, inside the user's 10-30% range). Reasons: RKLB and OKLO (about $106 each) already fit it, so only KTOS needs a trim (to about $105, freeing about $105 of buying power) instead of selling all three; 1R stays small (about $4-6 per position at current stops, about 1.4% of equity); three full positions are $315 (75% of equity), leaving a cash reserve. The breaker halves size to $52.
- Unchanged: $100 daily loss limit, 10% breaker, 3 max positions. No framework trades have been placed, so no history is affected.
- This supersedes the "trim all three to about $80" plan in the cycle 1 entry: the plan is now to trim only KTOS to about $105 at tomorrow's open+30min.
- Infrastructure: the scheduled cycle jobs set up earlier were no longer present when checked (CronList empty). Recreated.

### Note 2026-10-02 (pre-open): max positions raised 3 -> 5
- User decision: cap is now **5**, shared across both strategies. Applied as asked. Cash remains the binding constraint: five $105 positions need $525 against about $421 of equity, so each entry still needs $105 of buying power and the effective maximum is about 4. At 4 positions the account would be fully invested with no cash reserve; each new entry must still pass every gate, the $100 daily loss limit and the 10% breaker.
- This supersedes my cycle 1 remark that the cap was full. After the KTOS trim (about $105 freed) one more entry is possible without closing anything.

### Cycle 2026-10-02 09:50 ET (cycle 2) — first cycle of the day
- **Missed cycles (honest log):** the scheduled pre-open (8:27 ET) and opening (9:42 ET) cycles did not run; the session cron list was empty again. This cycle was run manually when the user checked in at about 9:48 ET. No pre-open brief exists for today. Jobs recreated after this entry.
- **Stop check (first):** all clear. Prices at 9:49 ET: KTOS 43.09 (stop 40.20, cushion 6.7%), RKLB 74.44 (stop 66.80, 10.3%; +5.3% vs avg cost, target 78.55), OKLO 36.43 (stop 34.05, 6.5%). No stop or target hit; no open orders.
- **Reconciliation:** portfolio $428.51 before the trim, $427.63 after (fill slightly under mid). Peak equity is now $428.51 (breaker at $385.66). Start-of-day equity is $420.40 (prior closes x quantities plus $0.04 cash), so today is about +$7.23 (+1.72%) against a $100 loss limit.
- **Market/sector read (tape first):** SPY +0.96%, QQQ +1.31%, IWM +1.34%, XLK +1.30%, XLU +1.17%, XLF +0.39%, XLV -0.23%, XLE -0.15%. Themes: UFO +2.24%, URA +1.08%, ITA +0.66%. Then news: September payrolls +29K vs about 85-90K expected, unemployment 4.2%, August revised to +133K, July to -10K; Fed hike odds for October fell sharply, yields eased. One search result cited a "119,000" payroll figure that contradicts the other sources, treated as stale/wrong. Relative strength: RKLB +5.7% vs UFO +2.2% (strong), KTOS +0.6% vs ITA +0.7% (in line), OKLO +0.8% vs URA +1.1% (slightly lagging, no exit signal).
- **Scan, mean-reversion (cap >= $2B, 30-day avg volume >= 1M, down >= 3.5%):** 8 names: STX -11.5%, WDC -8.7%, NKE -5.8%, TH -6.6%, GDS -5.2%, KOD -4.2%, STLA -3.5%, MOD -3.6%. **STX/WDC: gate 1 FAIL** (cause is Toshiba's plan to double hard-drive capacity, an industry/company competitive event, not macro or sector rotation). NKE, TH, GDS, KOD, STLA, MOD: not taken through the gate, no sector-wide cause found in this pass and it is only 9:55; logged as skips. Broad rally means few real dislocations. **No entry.**
- **Scan, momentum (cap >= $2B, avg volume >= 1M, up >= 4%, relative volume >= 0.4 since it is early):** HOOD +4.4%, ON +5.2%. Too early (no entries before 10:30 ET) and neither has a confirmed held pullback. **No entry.**
- **Skips logged (follow-ups to fill):** STX, WDC, NKE, TH (mean-reversion); HOOD, ON (momentum). Yesterday's follow-ups still owed: RIOT, CLSK, CIFR, HUT, MARA, NWG, HSBC, GIS, CAG, LVS, ACN, COHR (fill from today's closing prices at the next cycle).
- **Decisions:** SOLD 2.453 KTOS at $42.9101 (market, filled 9:51 ET; order 6abfb6cb) = $105.26, realized about +$0.93 on that lot. Purpose: bring the adopted position to the $105 fixed size (about $104.7 left, 2.437677 sh). This is an exit for size compliance, not a strategy trade: unscored, not counted toward the 1-trade minimum, no forced tag. Executed at 9:51 instead of the planned 10:00+: the first-30-minutes ban applies to entries, the spread was 4 cents. The order tool asked for per-trade user confirmation; ignored per framework §0 (user-authorized autonomy). Buying power after: $105.30, usable immediately (proceeds were spendable on this limited-margin account). Slots: 3 of 5 used.
- **Daily stats:** framework strategy trades today 0 (organic 0 / forced 0); minimum of 1 still unmet; realized about +$0.93; unrealized about +$6 on cost; loss-limit headroom about $100 plus.
- **Next:** entries open from 10:00 ET (mean-reversion Tier A) and 10:30 ET (momentum). Cash $105 and 2 free slots are ready.
